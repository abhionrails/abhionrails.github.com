authentication for an API using devise gem. I couldn't find a sample
working application which does the same. So I created one.

  Currently I am working on a project which has both API and mobile
  apps. I had to implement authentication for the API. Since I have to
  implement the authentication for the non browser clients (iOS,
  Android) I won't be able to use session based authentication. So I
  started implementing token based authentication. I am using Devise
  gem for token based authentication. 
  <br /><br />
  <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> is a flexible authentication solution for Rails
  applications. If you <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/rails_authentication.html">search
  in ruby tool box</a> you will see that Devise is
  the most popular rails authentication plugin. Devise supports token
  based authentication too.
  <br /><br />
  <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Simple-Token-Authentication-Example">Token based authentication</a> means authentication using a token
  instead of a session cookie. Since non browser clients won't support
  session cookies we can't use session based authentication. There is
  another approach that is to <a href="https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/MobileApps">embed a web browser</a>. 
  <br /><br />
  By default devise won't support JSON. For that we have to add
  respond_to :json to the controller to override the default
  behavior. Even after adding respond_to to the controller some devise
  actions will do redirect instead of responding with proper json
  data. So we should override the devise controllers to implement
  custom json response. 
  <br /><br />
  I was searching for some sample application which implemented the
  Token based authentication for API using devise gem. But I couldn't
  find any sample working application. So I <a href="https://github.com/abhidsm/devise-token-api">created one</a> for future
  reference. Please let me know your feedback.
