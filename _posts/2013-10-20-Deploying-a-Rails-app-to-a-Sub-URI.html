<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
  Recently I was working on a POC application. And I had to deploy
  that application to show a demo. Since it is a POC app I had to
  deploy it as a Sub URI of an existing app.
  <br /><br />
  I modified the nginx conf file to set up the sub URI, based on the
  information from <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Nginx.html#deploying_rails_to_sub_uri">this
  doc</a>. I have added <b>passenger_base_uri</b> option to the conf,
  but that was just starting the application from the sub URI. All the
  URLs in the application is using the base URL instead of the sub URI.
  <br /><br />
  To make all the URLs from the application use the sub URI as the
  base URL, I had to add a scope in the routes:
  <pre class="prettyprint">
SubUriApp::Application.routes.draw do
  my_draw = Proc.new do
   devise_for :users
  end

  if ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT']
   scope ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] do
     my_draw.call
   end
  else
   my_draw.call
  end
end
  </pre></br>
  The scope I added to the routes was not working with the
  passenger_base_uri added to the nginx conf. So I have to modify the
  nginx conf like the following: 
  <pre class="prettyprint">
server {
        listen 80;
        server_name base_url.com;
	location / {
        	root /www/base_url.com/current/public;
	        rails_env production;
        	passenger_enabled on;
	}

	location /sub_uri {
        	root /www/sub_uri/current/public;
	        rails_env production;
        	passenger_enabled on;
	}
    }
  </pre><br />
  Even after these changes the assets were loaded from the base URL. I
  had to set the following configuration in the environment file
  (production.rb) to make it work:
  <pre class="prettyprint">
ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT'] = "/sub_uri"
config.assets.prefix = ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT']
  </pre>
  <br />
  At last the application started working like a normal application
  from the sub URI :)
