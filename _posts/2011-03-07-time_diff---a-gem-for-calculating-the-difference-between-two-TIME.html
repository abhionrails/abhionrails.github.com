<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
  Yesterday I created a gem for calculating the difference between two
  TIME.
  <br /><br />
  When I was working in my office, we found that there is no method to
  extract the difference between two Time in a useful format like
  years, month, week, day, hour, minute and second.
  <br /><br />
  time1 - time2 return only difference inseconds.
  <br /><br />
  So I created this
  gem <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/time_diff">time_diff</a>&nbsp;which
  return the hash with difference:
  <br /><br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cc0000; font-family:
                                        'Courier New', Courier,
                                        monospace;">
    { :year =&gt; 0, :month =&gt; 0, :day =&gt; 0, :week =&gt; 0, :hour
  =&gt; 0, :minute =&gt; 0, :second =&gt; 0 }
    </span>
  <br /><br />
</div>
