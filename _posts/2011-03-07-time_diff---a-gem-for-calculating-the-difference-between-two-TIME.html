<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Yesterday I created a gem for calculating the difference between two TIME.<br /><br />When I was working in my office, we found that there is no method to extract the difference between two Time in a useful format like years, month, week, day, hour, minute and second.<br /><br />time1 - time2 return only difference inseconds.<br /><br />So I created this gem <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/time_diff">time_diff</a>&nbsp;which return the hash with difference:<br /><br />{ :year =&gt; 0, :month =&gt; 0, :day =&gt; 0, :week =&gt; 0, :hour =&gt; 0, :minute =&gt; 0, :second =&gt; 0 }<br /><br /><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7585462888260154580-5906252203540403384?l=abhionrails.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
