<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
  For my current project I had to setup Admin console. I used Active
  Admin for that purpose. It is very easy to setup an Admin
  console. And they have a very
  good <a href="http://www.activeadmin.info/documentation.html">documentation</a>. But
  if you want make some customization you have to spent some time
  digging for solution. Following are some customization I made to
  improve the Admin console: 
  <br /><br />
  <h1>1.member_label</h1>
  If you are using select box for showing association in form page or
  filters, it will show the object string if there is no attribute
  'name' for that model. By default the select box will take the name
  attribute of the model as the values. So you have to use member_label to specify
  the attribute you want to show in the select box. 
  <pre class="prettyprint">
f.input :user, :as => :select, :member_label => :email
  </pre>
  <br />
  <h1>2.Custom Menu</h1>
  I had to modify the menus by grouping some menus to sub-menus. I
  have added the following code to initializers/active_admin.rb:
  <pre class="prettyprint">
 admin.build_menu do |menu|
   menu.add :label => "Product", :priority => 2
 end
  </pre></br>
  This will create a main menu 'Product'. To add sub-menus you have to
  mention this menu as the parent.
  <pre class="prettyprint">
 menu :parent => "Product", :priority => 3
  </pre></br>
  Here priority is the order in which we need to show the sub-menu.
  <br /><br />
  <h1>3.Custom Actions</h1>
  For one model Admin doesn't have the privilege to create new
  record. So I have to remove the new action from the Admin
  console. So I added the following code:
  <pre class="prettyprint">
actions :all, :except => [:new]
  </pre>
  <br />
  <h1>4.Columns in show page</h1>
  For one of my model, in the show page I felt there are lots of space
  available in the right side. But to show something in the right side
  I had to customize the show page. So I used columns to show multiple
  associated data in the show page:
  <pre class="prettyprint">
show do |product_request|
  columns do
    column do
      attributes_table do
        row :id
        row :user
      end
    end

    column do
      active_admin_comments
    end
  end
    
  columns do
    column do
      h3 "Businesses"
      table_for resource.businesses do 
        column :id
        column :business
      end
    end

    column do
      h3 "Products"
      table_for resource.products do 
        column :id
        column :product
      end
    end
  end
end
  </pre>
  <br />
  <h1>5.Link to filter of another model</h1>
  For one of the models (For Eg. User) I had to show a link in the index page to
  show list of associated data (For Eg. Business) ie., I have to show
  the index page of business with a filter of user.
  <pre class="prettyprint">
column "Businesses" do |user|
  link_to "Click", :controller => "businesses", 
                   :action => "index", 'q[user_id_eq]' => "#{user.id}".html_safe
end
  </pre>
  <br />
</div>
