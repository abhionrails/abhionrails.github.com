  Today I had spent a lot of time fixing an after_save callback issue related with <a href="https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on">acts_as_taggable_on</a> gem. We're associating keyword tag to a model using the following command:
  <br /><br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #990000; font-family:
  'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
    acts_as_taggable_on :keywords
  </span>
  <br /><br />
  And we've a after_save call back in that model which uses the updated keywords. But the issue was in the callback, if you reload the object you will lose the new keywords associated with it, because the keywords are not yet saved.
  <br /><br />
  Then I Googled about this issue and found the following blog which
  helped me to solve the
  issue: <a href="http://blog.romanandreg.com/post/176944361/activerecord-callbacks-acts-as-taggable-gotcha">http://blog.romanandreg.com/post/176944361/activerecord-callbacks-acts-as-taggable-gotcha</a>
  I tried with the <b>update_tags</b> mentioned in the blog, but with
  the latest acts_as_taggable_on gem this fix is not working. Then I
  gone through the code
  of <a href="https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on">acts_as_taggable_on</a>
  gem, and in core.rb I found the following line:
  <br /><br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #990000; font-family:
  'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
    after_save :save_tags
  </span>
  <br /><br />
  Then I tried calling <b>save_tags</b> from my callback method. Thats
  it! It got fixed!!
