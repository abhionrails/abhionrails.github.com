  Today I had gone through an issue, which got fixed by using the
  marked_for_destruction? method. This marked_for_destruction is part
  of Active Record Autosave Association module. Autosave Association
  module takes care of automatically saving associated records when
  their parent is saved. For more details see
  <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/AutosaveAssociation.html">
    Auto Save Association
  </a>.
  <br /><br />
  In my project I have a model called Directory and it has many
    Categories. But I have to add a validation that there should be
    atleast one category associated with the directory. So in the
    directory model I added a validation in the after_save callback,
    which will check the count of Categories is greater that 0.
  <br /><br />
  But while we do the update directory if I deleted all the
    categories&nbsp;the validation won't work , because I am using
    Autosave Association, which &nbsp;saves category only after
    directory got saved. So at the time of Directory got saved the
    category count was greater than one, so validation will pass. To
    fix this issue I changed the condition that the categories count
    should be greater than 1. This is handled in the Directory model,
    and I want to let the controller know about the Directory not get
    saved. For that I will throw an exception if the condition fails.

    &nbsp; &nbsp;if self.categories.count &lt;= 1

  <br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cc0000; font-family:
                                        'Courier New', Courier,
                                        monospace;">
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw Exception
  </span>
  <br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cc0000; font-family:
                                        'Courier New', Courier,
                                        monospace;">
    &nbsp; &nbsp;end
  </span>
  <br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cc0000; font-family:
                                        'Courier New', Courier,
                                        monospace;">
    end
  </span>
  <br /><br />
  Since the condition is checking for categories greater than 1 this
  will fail for update with only one category. Because on update also
  it will execute the after_save and there is only 1 category
  associated with this directory. But it should fail if we are
  deleting the only one category. So I added one more condition that
  checks if the only one category is marked for delete. So the
  condition becomes:
  <br /><br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cc0000; font-family:
  'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
    if self.categories.first.nil? ||
    self.categories.first.maked_for_destruction?
  </span>
  <br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cc0000; font-family:
                                        'Courier New', Courier,
                                        monospace;">
    &nbsp; &nbsp;throw Exception
  </span>
  <br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cc0000; font-family:
                                        'Courier New', Courier,
                                        monospace;">
    end
  </span>
  <br /><br />
  Now it will fail only if the user tries to delete the last category.
