<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
  Recently I had to work on a feature "As a User ISBAT see the
  Business sorted by distance". We are using Geokit gem for
  manipulating the location. And we have the models 'Business' has
  many 'Location's.
  <br /><br />
  I had to fetch the businesses in the order of the distance of the
  locations from the origin. The origin is the point which we will
  pass to the method. Since this method should be part of a chained
  named scope, I had to implement this as a named scope.
  <br /><br />
  After done some searching I found a useful link
  from <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/users/nick/blog/articles/284-hasfinder-it-s-now-easier-than-ever-to-create-complex-re-usable-sql-queries">pivotallabs</a>. At
  the end there is one comment from Keith:
  <br /><br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #990000;
      font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; ">
    named_scope :within, lambda{|o, d| 
    <br />      
    &nbsp;origin = o
    <br />
    &nbsp;distance_sql = self.distance_sql(origin)
    <br />
    &nbsp;within = d
    <br />
    &nbsp;{:select =&gt; "*, #{distance_sql} as distance",
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;:conditions =&gt; "#{distance_sql} &lt;= #{within}",&nbsp;
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;:order =&gt; 'distance asc'}}
  </span>
  <br /><br />
  This code helped me to create a named scope which will fetch the
  businesses in the order of the distance.
  <br /><br />
  The test also passed for this named scope. But in the controller,
  where I am using this named scope along with other named scopes i,e,
  chained named scope, the named scope was not working as expected. It
  was throwing MySql Error with message "distance is undefined".
  <br /><br />
  After done with some searching I found
  the <a href="http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=26769">link</a>&nbsp;which
  explains that in chain named_scopes only conditions will get added,
  and selects will get ignored.
  <br /><br />
  Then I tried by changing the 'distance' variable with
  the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #990000;
  font-family: 'Courier New', Courier,
  monospace;">distance_sql</span><span class="Apple-style-span"
  style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;as the order value. And it
  worked:</span>
  <br /><br />
  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #990000; font-family:
  'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
    named_scope :by_location, lambda{|origin, within|
    <br /> 
    &nbsp;distance_sql = Location.distance_sql(origin)
    <br />
    &nbsp;{:select =&gt; "*",
    <br /> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;:conditions =&gt; "#{distance_sql} &lt;= #{within}",&nbsp;
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;:order =&gt; '#{distance_sql}', :joins =&gt; :locations }}
  </span>
  <br /><br />
</div>
