  <p>For my latest spare time
  project <a href="http://www.kazhakkoottam.com">Kazhakkoottam</a> I
  had to integrate friendly id with the app. But the application was
  already integrated and running with Inherited Resource and Active
  Admin. So while integrating with friendly id I have faced some
  issues.</p>
  <p>
  So why we need to use friendly id?
  <br/>
  <a href="https://github.com/norman/friendly_id">FriendlyId</a> is
  used to implement pretty URL's, so that it will be SEO friendly and
  can be identified easily. Instead of id's you can configure name or
  title field as the slug. For example
  http://www.kazhakkoottam.com/items/krishna-theatre is the friendly
  id for http://www.kazhakkoottam.com/items/1.

  Integration issue with Inherited Resource
  <br/>
  The first issue I faced was in the show page of an Item in
  ItemsController. ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound Couldn't find Item
  with id=lorem-ipsum. The reason is Inherited resource was using
  Item.find instead of Item.friendly.find()
  <br/>
  Added the following code to the ItemsController to fix this issue:
  <pre class="prettyprint">
    # app/controllers/items_controller.rb
    defaults resource_class: Item.friendly
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Integration issue with Active Admin
    <br/>
    Then I faced the same issue with Active Admin while accessed the show
    page of the item from Admin console. The solution was to add the
    following code to the active admin file for item.
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      # app/admin/item.rb
      controller do
        def find_resource
          scoped_collection.friendly.find(params[:id])
        end
      end
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now I got the pretty URL integrated with my app which is SEO
    friendly and can be identified easily.
