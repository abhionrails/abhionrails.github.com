<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
  <p><a href="http://activeadmin.info">Active Admin</a> is a Ruby on Rails plugin to generate Admin console for the application. It has a lots of functionalities implemented out of the box where we just need to integrate it and use it. Most of the time you donâ€™t need to customize the plugin.</p>
  <p>
    But the main Advantage of Active Admin is that you can customize almost all the built-in functionalities. The main functionalities are: Navigation, User Authentication, Scopes, Action Items, Index styles, Filters, Sidebar sections, API and Downloads.
  </p>
  <p>
    By default Active Admin will generate the pages to CRUD a model when you generate the resource file for the model using rails generator:
  <pre class="prettyprint">
    $> rails generate active_admin:resource [MyModelName]
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    But what if in your application you need an Admin page where you want to show some calculated data of a model or multiple models which is obviously not a resource file. You can create custom pages:
  </p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/abhidsm/9abb3331e61e1e8678671a7a9d812cbd.js?file=calendar.rb"></script>
  <p>
    Now you can put your view/html content in the partial:
  </p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/abhidsm/9abb3331e61e1e8678671a7a9d812cbd.js?file=_calendar.html.arb"></script>
  <p>
    This is enough to create a simple custom page which will show the data in a customized view. But in some situation you need a button to perform some operations like download the data. In those situations you need custom action and action item. Modified custom page:
  </p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/abhidsm/9abb3331e61e1e8678671a7a9d812cbd.js?file=updated_calendar.rb"></script>
  <p>
    You can also add custom filters to filter the data. You just need to add the following line to the custom page:
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      sidebar :filter, partial: 'filter'
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    and create a view for the filter partial
  </p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/abhidsm/9abb3331e61e1e8678671a7a9d812cbd.js?file=_filter.html.arb"></script>
  <p>
    You need to use the filter params in your custom page to filter the data:
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      Transaction.where(:type => /.*#{params[:type]}.*/)
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    As I mentioned before, this is the greatest advantage of using Active Admin. You can customize almost all the functionalities :)
